## Why get a certificate?

Yeah, I know - IT Certificates are a race to the bottom and any employer who require them probably do not deserve your time.

But there's upside to really learning & getting a certificate. If the exam is hard, passing it probably requires in-depth knowledge from you.

Google's Professional Cloud Architect fits the bill - it is hands-on & hard.
